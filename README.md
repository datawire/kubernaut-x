# Kubernaut/X (WIP/Experimental)

Kubernaut/X now with more Go.

This repo tracks an experimental reimplementation of Kubernaut in Go.

## Phase 1

1. Rebuild Kubernaut in Go.
2. Consolidate the broker and agent into a single binary.
3. Expose the CLI and an API that can be consumed via other projects.
4. Simplify the broker <-> agent communication.

## Phase 2

1. Ease development of Kubernaut so that additional engineers can hack on it (reduce SPoF).
2. Improve administrative insights in Kubernaut (e.g. who is using what etc)
